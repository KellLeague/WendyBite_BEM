            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorcée) 
                    sharing a house in Miami, Florida. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche 
                    Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (Betty White) 
                    and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur). They both responded to a room-for-rent ad 
                    on the bulletin board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a 
                    gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently removed.[5] The three were 
                    soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after the retirement 
                    home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.  </p>
